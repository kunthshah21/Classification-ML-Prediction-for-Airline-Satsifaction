# Classification ML Prediction for Airline Satisfaction
This is a current ML project, where I will perform classification for the Airline Satisfaction dataset. 

This model's big picture or goal is to predict whether or not the customer is satisfied. The insights gathered in this model will help dictate, whether a potential customer would be happy based on their flight-journey attributes. This would essentially allow the airline company to serve better to their customers and customise their services, according to individual customers. 

This is going to be a supervised learning task. The performance measure for this model is the accuracy rate. I have used a bunch of ML models and tested them to find the best one applicable to this dataset. This list of ML models includes - KNN, etc.
